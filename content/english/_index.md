The simplest of treatments take care, due dilligence and passion to get right. A jagged nail line on your cuticle will ruin great artwork and a massage being rushed from interruptions will not leave you feeling relaxed mentally nor physically. Even simpler than that, parking in town to rush your way down the high street isn't a great way to start or end your me time. We like to think Bella Beauti is the place to come for dedicated you time, peace of mind and ease from beginning to end.

Treatments are delivered to high standards and we book buffer slots before and after every treatment to ensure that the next customer isn't adding un-needed pressure.

This website is under construction, but you can check out our treatments [here.](treatments)

Coming soon, we'll be adding waxing and online booking.

We accept cash and all major debit and credit cards.
